# Jaff.js

Just Another Frontend Framework (technically a library but i liked the acronym JAFF).

I've built this library to deeply understand how the frameworks we use every day work.

Resources:

- ["Build a frontend framework from scratch"](<(http://mng.bz/aM2o)>).

## Commands

This package has the following commands:

- `npm run serve:examples` - Starts an http server to serve the example applications
