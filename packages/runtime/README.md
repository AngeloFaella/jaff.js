# Jaff.js

Just Another Frontend Framework (technically a library but i liked the acronym JAFF).

I've built this library to deeply understand how the frameworks we use every day work.

Resources:

- ["Build a frontend framework from scratch"](<(http://mng.bz/aM2o)>).

## Commands

This package has the following commands:

- `npm run build` - Bundle the project into a single ESM file
- `npm run lint` - Lint the project
- `npm run lint:fix` - Lint the project and fix any issues
- `npm run test [<test-path>]` - Start the test runner in watch mode
- `npm run test:run [<test-path>]` - Run the tests once
